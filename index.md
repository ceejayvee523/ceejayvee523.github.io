# Paragraph
I am Carter Vail, I went to Saugerties High School in Saugerties, NY. My family consists of my mother and father, my two younger sisters and myself. We also have two cats, although I am more of a dog person myself. At my highschool I played tennis and soccer. I also co-founded our robotics club and was a captain of a robotics team. The thing I enjoy doing most in my free time is playing video games with my friends, I am currently very into Rocket League and Among Us. My favorite color is orange for no reason other than I like it, it also happens to be my dad's favorite color. My favorite food is mac and cheese.
